It is well known that the reversibility of Stokes flow makes it difficult for small microorganisms to swim. Inertial effects break this reversibility, allowing new mechanisms
of propulsion and feeding. Therefore it is important to understand the effects of unsteady
and fluid inertia on the dynamics of microorganisms in flow. In this work, we show how
to translate known inertial effects for nonmotile organisms to motile ones, from passive to
active particles. The method relies on a principle used earlier by Legendre and Magnaudet
(1997) to deduce inertial corrections to the lift force on a bubble from the inertial drag on
a solid sphere, using the fact that small inertial effects are determined by the far field of
the disturbance flow. The method allows us, for example, to compute the inertial effect of
unsteady fluid accelerations on motile organisms, and the inertial forces such organisms
experience in steady shear flow. We explain why the method fails to describe the effect of
convective fluid inertia.
