My name is Tommaso Redaelli and I am currently a Ph.D. student in Physics (Fluid Mechanics and Biophysics) at the University of Aix-Marseille, France. I obtained my BSc at the Università degli Studi di Milano and my MSc in [Physics of Complex Systems](http://www.pcs.polito.it/) at the Politecnico di Torino. During my, I spent a semester in Trieste at [S.I.S.S.A.](https://www.sissa.it/)  and [I.C.T.P](https://www.ictp.it/), a semster in Torino at [Polito](https://www.polito.it/) and a semester in [Paris-Sud](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) and [Paris-Diderot](https://u-paris.fr/).


I am working at the [Institut de recherches sur les phénomènes hors équilibre](https://irphe.univ-amu.fr/) the at the [c0pep0d](https://c0pep0d.github.io/) project, under the supervision of Christophe Eloy and Fabien Candelier. I am currently investigating the swimming abilities of millimetric-size organisms, and the tracking strategies of the planktonic world.


I spent 4 months as s visiting PhD at the [Kanso Lab](https://sites.usc.edu/kansolab/), at the University of Souther California, working under the supervision of Eva Kanso with his wonderful group of collaborators.
