My name is Tommaso Redaelli, Ph.D. graduate in Physics (Fluid Mechanics and Biophysics) at the University of Aix-Marseille, France. I obtained my BSc in Physics at the Università degli Studi di Milano and my MSc in the [Physics of Complex Systems](http://www.pcs.polito.it/) at the Politecnico di Torino. 
Durign my master I spent a semester in Trieste at [S.I.S.S.A.](https://www.sissa.it/)  and [I.C.T.P](https://www.ictp.it/), a semester in Torino at [Polito](https://www.polito.it/) and a semester in Paris at [Paris-Sud](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) and [Paris-Diderot](https://u-paris.fr/).


I am working at the [Institut de recherches sur les phénomènes hors équilibre](https://irphe.univ-amu.fr/) involved in the [c0pep0d](https://c0pep0d.github.io/) project, under the supervision of Christophe Eloy and Fabien Candelier. I am currently investigating the swimming abilities of millimetric-size organisms, and the tracking strategies of the planktonic world.


I spent 4 months as a visiting PhD student at the [Kanso Lab](https://sites.usc.edu/kansolab/), at the University of Southern California, working under the supervision of Eva Kanso with his wonderful group of collaborators.

I am an Outdoor Sport Lover.

**Future**: Seeking job opportunities to exploit statistics and fluid mechanics competences and develop further professional skills.
